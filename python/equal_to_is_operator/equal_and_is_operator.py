Summary: "==" and "is" operator in python
========

* In python each object has value and identity

* Value can be compared using "==" operator.

* Identity is verified using "is" operator.

* Two objects can have same value but different identity.

* value comparision    : "x == y"

* identity comparision : "x is y"

* "is" operator can be explained as shorthand for "id(x) == id(y)"

* Eg.
    >> x = 1.0
    >> y = 1
    >> x == y
       True
    >> x is y
       False
