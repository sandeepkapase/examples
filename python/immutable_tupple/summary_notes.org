* Official Python docs often refer to variables as “names”. Variables are names we give to objects.
** When we assing variable to another variable, we are actually creating new alias to actual object.


* Every object has an identity, a type and a value.
** An object’s identity never changes once it has been created;
** You may think of it as the object’s address in memory.
** The ‘is’ operator compares the identity of two objects;
** The id() function returns an integer representing its identity.
