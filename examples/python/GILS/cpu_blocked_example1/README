While performing any CPU intensive in python, multiple thread execution will
actually bottle neck execution due to GIL.

In this example we have some CPU intensive execution without thread and with
thread. Results shows that multithread execution did not show any performance 
improvement but it actually degraded performance of execution i.e. due to GIL.

Conclusion:
============
In python, CPU intensive workload execution with multiple thread will actually
degrade performance of execution.
