* don't use ALL_CAPS in Go names; use CamelCase

* useful go tools/packages:
** https://github.com/mgechev/revive ==> dropin replacement for golintv
** https://github.com/TrueFurby/go-callvis ==> call graph
** https://github.com/emacsmirror/godoctor ==> golang refactoring engine (emacs plugin support)

* Unit Test:
=============
** Open visual Web UI for code coverage
*** # test -coverprofile cover.out
*** # go tool cover -html=cover.out

** Open visual Web UI for code coverage for particular Unit test (COLOR COVERAGE)
*** # gotest git.druva.org/druva.com/RealizeCommon/licensing -v -coverprofile=coverage.out -run Test_ListCustomers ;  go tool cover -html=coverage.out
*** ==> Here "Test_ListCustomers" unit test will be executed from package git.druva.org/druva.com/RealizeCommon/licensing
*** # uncover coverage.out ==> does same thing. Instead of web, it show visual coverage on terminal.
*** ==> install it with "go get -u github.com/gregoryv/uncover/..."

** Color output for go test (NOT Coverage)
*** Install: go get -u github.com/cweill/gotests/...
*** run "gotest" instead of "go test"
*** parameter to "go test" are also valid for "gotest"
*** show green/read output depeneding on test success/faillure.

** go package documentations
